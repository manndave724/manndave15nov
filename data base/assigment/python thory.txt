what is program?
 it is a set of instructions
 
 what is programing?
	to create a program,we use programing.
	
types of programing languages:-

(1) low level language:- machine language 0 and 1(Binary value)
(2) high level language:- c,c++,python,java,php,etc,-human understable form

SDLC:- software development life cycle

1) requirement gathering 

2) Analysis

3)designing--frontend(HTML,CSS,JS,reactjs,etc.)

4)coading-- backend(python,java,php,etc)

5)testing-- 

6)maintainence--

compiler:- it translates code from high level language to low level language.
--> it read whole code at once and then give error
--> c,c++

interpreter:-
--> it reads the code line by line and then give error 
--> python,java,etc.

whatis python?
--> python is a interpreted,object oriented and high level programing language

uses and applications of python:-
1) web applications :-

2) desktop applications:-

3) machine learning 

4)artificial intelligence 

5) data science/ data analysis

features or benefits of python:-
1) Easy syntax

2) fast

3) easy to use 

Escape sequence:-

1)\n--new line 
2)\t--tab(4 spaces)
3)\b--backspace

datatypes and variables:-
Datatypes:-
		integer-Without point-78
		float-with point--78.56
		boolean-True and false
		string-"manav"
		complex-56j
		
variabels:- to store a value
		    a=79
			b=89
			manav=89.99
			
rules of variabels:-
 
 1)variabels should not contain keywords:- int=67x
 2)variabels should not start with numbers:- --> invalid :-1mun x
											 --> valid :-numbers2
											 
 3)variabels should not contain white spaces:- no of balls x
											   no_of_balls_x
											   
 4)variabels should start with a-z or A-Zor_
 
 dynamic -- input()--user input
 
 oprators:- to perform the oprations between the two operands,a+b
 
 types of oprators
 1)arithmatic oprators:- +,-,*,/,%
 
 2) assiment oprators:- =,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=
 
 3)conditional or relational oprators:- ==
	boolean valuse:- true and false 
	
4) logical oprators:- 
-> logical and(&&) :- returns true if both the statements were true 

logical OR:- returns true if one of the statements were true 

logical NOT:- it reverse the result, it returns false if both the statements were true 

5) membership oprators:- in,not in 

Conditional Statements:-

1) if statement
2) if else statement
3) elif statement or if elif ladder


syntax:-

	if condition:
		statement
	elif condition:
		statement
	else:
		statement

Task:- Write a python program to check if the 
given number is positive,negative or zero

Task:- Write a python program to take the name of 
a person and check if he is eligible to vote or 
not.


Control Structures:-

Loops in Python:-
To execute a statement repeatedly

Types of Loops:-

1) For Loop
--> Nested For Loop

2) While Loop


range()- To find the range between the numbers.

range(starting range,ending range,jump)



Task:- Write a python program to check whether the
given letter is vowel or not.

Output-- Boolean values -- True or False

4) Logical Operators:-

Logical AND-- Returns true if both the statements were true
 and

Logical OR-- Returns true if one of the statements were true
 or

Logical NOT-- It reverse the result,it returns false if both
the statements were true

5) Membership Operators-- list

	in,not in
